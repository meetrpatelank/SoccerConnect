Welcome to Soccer Connect!

Soccer Connect is a social soccer network that allows players and teams to connect with each
other. It is quite a tedious job to look for teams physically and be part of them, similarly, it is
difficult for the teams as well to find their best fit player. Soccer Connect is a social internet
platform that allows players to find their dream team from the available list of teams posted on
the portal. It also allows teams to find the various players registered on the portal and request
the players to join their teams.

This web application comes with a lot of other features other than connecting players with the
teams. As a player or a team, you are regularly reported on your statistics. This will help the
players/team to analyse their performances and take necessary actions. A player can leave any
team at any point of time and similarly a team can remove any player.
